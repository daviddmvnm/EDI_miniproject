# EDI_miniproject

*This project was developed on two long train ride using parts of an old scrapped project, consider this more of a proof of concept test*

This prototype was developed as an early-stage model to explore how satellite-derived
indicators and socioeconomic data can assess relative electrification performance across
geographies. The current version is a simplified proof of concept, laying a conceptual
and technical foundation for a more advanced tool. Future extensions could integrate
higher-resolution data and predictive modeling to support actionable insights for energy
planning and investment.
